Calculator

This is a simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, as well as decimal point and clear functions.

Getting Started

To use the calculator, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The calculator interface should appear, allowing you to perform calculations.

Usage

The calculator features a grid of buttons for entering numbers and operators. Clicking on these buttons will add them to the current calculation. The current calculation is displayed in the result area.

To perform a calculation, click on the = button. The result will be displayed in the result area, and the current calculation will be stored for further use.

To clear the current calculation, click on the C button. This will reset the calculator to its initial state.

Notes

This calculator application was built as a simple project to practice web development skills. It may not be suitable for all use cases, and may not be as reliable as more robust calculator applications.
